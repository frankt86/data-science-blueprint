Updating cookiecutter template
########
The cookiecutter template is written in the file ``cookiecutter.json``. You are free to update the file and add
(or remove) the parameters that you need. Keep in mind that if you update this file, you will need to crawl the blueprint
code in order to integrate the new parameters.

If you want more information about how to update the ``cookiecutter.json`` file, you can take a look at the
`cookiecutter documentation <https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/first_steps.html>`_

Updating the Makefile
########
If you want to add new commands, or update existing commands, you are free to open the file ``Makefile``, and update it
according to your needs.
