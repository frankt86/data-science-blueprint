Make this your own
==================================================

The very purpose of this blueprint is that you make it your own. That said, you are allowed to bring any modifications
you want to the blueprint. You can fork it, change any part you want, use it for commercial or non commercial use, and
even republish it under your own brand if you wish to.

Feel free to give me your feedbacks. With your feedbacks, I can design some new features. I will integrate them
into the blueprint, and update the documentation. As I have said before, the project is available on github,
`here <https://github.com/mysketches/data-science-blueprint>`_. You can also easily clone it like this::

        git clone https://github.com/mysketches/data-science-blueprint.git

If you wish to contribute to my project, I'd be glad to receive your pull requests on Github. If you see a bug, or
something os not clear, you can also create an issue on Github.
